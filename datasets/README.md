  <b>Kaggle</b>
</summary>

[Kaggle - Data Science Platform](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

Kaggle is an Online-Community, that is made for Data Scientists. Here, you can learn coding, take on Data Science-Challenges and exchange datasets with others. For your project, you can search for interesting datasets.

> ðŸŸ¨ __Note__ ðŸŸ¨
>
> The datasets on the plattform are usually highly preprocessed, which does not represent the "real-world" situation. Also, they could contain errors, as they are not moderated by the platform. Keep that in mind when you consider using a dataset from Kaggle.

[Machine Learning Datasets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets)

The Irvine Machine Learning Repository contains many datasets suitable for Machine Learning projects. Some prominent ones are e. g. the Iris or the Dry Bean dataset. The big advantage of the platform: You already get some information on what to use the dataset for, e. g., what is the predictor, are there missing values, what are the variables, etc.
