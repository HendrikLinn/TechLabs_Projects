# Find the right dataset <a name="findit"></a>
Most groups struggle finding a dataset that fits their project best. But there are some tips that can help you:
- **focus on your goal**: What is the goal of your project? Do you have specific data points or features you want to dive into? Also, it could help focussing on a specific domain first. Start small - there is always room for more data and features!
- **size matters**: You will need enough meaningful data to support your research question, product or goal that you want to fulfill. If you look for datasets, keep your goal in mind and always consider the size of the dataset before starting with the exploratory data analysis.
- **no data? new idea**: In case you cannot find any suitable data for your project idea, then leave it and search for a different idea. It is not useful to put a lot of effort into data collection because you will certainly lack the time later in your project.

[Kaggle - Data Science Platform](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

Kaggle is an Online-Community, that is made for Data Scientists. Here, you can learn coding, take on Data Science-Challenges and exchange datasets with others. For your project, you can search for interesting datasets.

> ðŸŸ¨ __Note__ ðŸŸ¨
>
> The datasets on the plattform are usually highly preprocessed, which does not represent the "real-world" situation. Also, they could contain errors, as they are not moderated by the platform. Keep that in mind when you consider using a dataset from Kaggle.

[Machine Learning Datasets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets)

The Irvine Machine Learning Repository contains many datasets suitable for Machine Learning projects. Some prominent ones are e. g. the Iris or the Dry Bean dataset. The big advantage of the platform: You already get some information on what to use the dataset for, e. g., what is the predictor, are there missing values, what are the variables, etc.
